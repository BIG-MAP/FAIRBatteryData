# FAIRBatteryData
This repository demonstrates a working proof-of-concept for how the Battery Interface Ontology (BattINFO) can be used to create semantically annotated battery data. Achieving this objective means developing not only the ontology itself, but also the associated data models and RDF triple mapping and querying infrastructure needed to perform practical actions on real battery datasets. In this first use-case, we create battery cell metadata for a cell that has been reported in the literature and link it with simulated time-series data obtained from the open-source Battery Modelling Toolbox (BattMo). The resulting metadata are mapped to BattINFO terms using RDF triples and saved in a triplestore. We demonstrate a simple semantic query of the triplestore using SPARQL.

The aim of this demonstration is to annotate cell-level and time-series battery data with BattINFO. Annotating data to ontology terms is achieved by defining semantic RDF triples, which take the form: subject, predicate, object. While in this case the subject and the predicate can be obtained from the relevant ontologies, we need an adequate data model to serve as a basis for identifying the object of the triple. We achieve this by creating instances in DLite. DLite instances are simple metadata that can be linked to or generated from ontologies. They provide property fields that can be populated with data coming from standard sources such as csv, xlsx, json, or data bases like Postgresql, etc. A conceptual overview of the layers linking raw data to ontology terms is presented in the following figure.
